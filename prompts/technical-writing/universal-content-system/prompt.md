- Typical length: 800-1,200 words

**B) Decision-Support (Choice-focused):**
- Outcome: Audience can evaluate options and make informed decisions
- Success metric: Can complete decision framework or scoring rubric
- Format: Decision criteria → Option analysis → Trade-offs → Selection tools
- Typical length: 1,000-1,500 words

**C) Process-Oriented (Implementation-focused):**
- Outcome: Audience can execute specific tasks or workflows
- Success metric: Can complete first step of process within 24 hours
- Format: Prerequisites → Step-by-step guide → Troubleshooting → Validation

**Current Impact:** [What's the cost of not solving this? Time, money, opportunities?]
**Success Criteria:** [How will you know this content solved the problem?]
**Timeline:** [When do stakeholders need to apply this information?]

Example: 'Our operations team (Level 2) needs to evaluate automation tools (Decision-Support) because current manual processes take 15 hours weekly, costing us $75K annually in labor. Success means they can complete tool evaluation within 3 weeks.'"

**TECHNICAL SCOPE BOUNDARIES:**
"Define the scope using these parameters:

**Primary Focus:** [Choose: Conceptual Understanding, Implementation Process, Strategic Implications]
**Technical Depth:** [Choose: High-level overview, Detailed mechanics, Expert-level analysis]
**Scope Boundaries:** [What topics should be excluded to maintain focus?]
**Prerequisites:** [What concepts must the audience already understand?]
**Integration Points:** [How does this connect to other topics they need to know?]"

### Approval Gate:
"Based on your responses, I will create [Content Type] content about [Topic Domain] at [Technical Level] focusing on [Primary Scope] to solve [Specific Business Problem]. The content will be [Length Range] and success will be measured by [Specific Metric]. 

**Proceed? (Confirm before content creation begins)**"
