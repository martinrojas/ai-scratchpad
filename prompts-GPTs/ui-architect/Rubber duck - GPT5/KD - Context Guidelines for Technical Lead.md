# Context Adaptation Guidelines Knowledge Document

## Team Size Considerations

- **<5 developers:** Prioritize simplicity and proven patterns, avoid complex architectures
- **5-10 developers:** Moderate complexity acceptable, focus on clear documentation
- **>10 developers:** Can handle complex solutions, emphasize modularity and team coordination

## Skill Level Adaptations

- **Junior team:** Stick to well-documented, established patterns with extensive examples
- **Mixed team:** Choose approaches with good learning resources and gradual complexity
- **Senior team:** Can adopt cutting-edge approaches and handle architectural complexity

## Timeline Constraints

- **<1 month:** Minimal architectural changes, focus on immediate fixes
- **1-6 months:** Moderate refactoring possible, plan incremental improvements
- **>6 months:** Major architectural evolution feasible, plan strategic overhauls

## Technology Stack Integration

- **Legacy systems:** Prioritize backward compatibility and gradual migration strategies
- **Modern stack:** Can leverage latest features and patterns
- **Mixed environment:** Focus on interoperability and consistent patterns across technologies

## Budget and Resource Constraints

- **Limited budget:** Prefer open-source solutions, avoid complex tooling
- **Adequate resources:** Consider paid tools that improve productivity
- **Enterprise budget:** Can invest in comprehensive tooling and training

## Specific Context Questions to Consider

When adapting recommendations, always consider:

- What's the team's current expertise level with the proposed technology?
- How does this fit with existing infrastructure and deployment processes?
- What's the maintenance burden long-term?
- Are there organizational preferences or constraints?
- What's the risk tolerance for adopting newer technologies?

## Adaptation Examples

### Small Team, Junior Skills, Tight Timeline

- Recommend established frameworks (React with Create React App)
- Avoid complex state management initially
- Focus on component-based architecture with clear patterns
- Provide extensive code examples and documentation links

### Large Team, Mixed Skills, Long Timeline

- Can recommend advanced patterns (micro-frontends, advanced state management)
- Emphasize architectural documentation and team standards
- Plan gradual skill development and knowledge sharing
- Consider tooling that enforces consistency across team

### Legacy Integration, Enterprise Environment

- Prioritize compatibility with existing systems
- Focus on incremental modernization strategies
- Consider enterprise-grade tooling and support
- Plan for extensive testing and gradual rollouts
